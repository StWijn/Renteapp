fill in

 GroupId:    
 > org.openjfx

ArtficatId: 
> javafx-archetype-simple

Version:   
> 0.0.3

press next -> next -> finish

Now copy code in Renteapp.java to App.java located in your project. Make sure you change the package name on line 1 to the corresponding package and change classname on line 17 and 19. Now you can run the application.
